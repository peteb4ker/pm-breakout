## Overview

The expander module comes with 3 ribbon cables, each of which connects to a different set of pins on the WMD performance mixer / Channels expander.

## 6-pin cable

The 6 pin connector plugs in to the `MSTR_OUT` pins on the back of the WMD performance mixer.  Ensure that the red stripe is down on both sides of the cable.

## 20-pin cable

The 20 pin connector plugs in to the `PRE_OUTS` pins on the back of the WMD performance mixer.  Ensure that the red stripe is down on both sides of the cable.

## 10-pin connector (optional)

The 10 pin connector plugs in to the `PRE_OUTS` pins on the back of the WMD Channels expander.  Ensure that the red stripe is down on both sides of the cable.

This cable should only be used if you have the PM Channels expander for the WMD performance mixer.  If you do not have this expander, channels 9 and 10 on the
pre-outs expander will not do anything.

10 pin connectors are also used for Eurorack power.  Don't ever plug this cable into the power header, and don't ever plug the expander module into a eurorack power bus.

## Mounting the modules

Once the cables have been connected, you can mount the modules together in your rack and power on the modules.
